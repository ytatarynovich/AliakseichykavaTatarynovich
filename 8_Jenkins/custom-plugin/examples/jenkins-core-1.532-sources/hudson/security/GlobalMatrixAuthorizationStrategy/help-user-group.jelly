    Different security realm has different conventions about group names.
    The best way to go about it is to login and see what group names you belong to,
    by going to <a href="${rootURL}/whoAmI" target="_new">this diagnostics page</a>.

    <p>
      A special group "authenticated" is also available, which represents all
      authenticated (logged in) users.
